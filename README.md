This Application was built with Angular JS. Basically, it is a catalog that displays a list of Android devices, lets you filter the list to see only devices that interest you, and then view details for any device.

In this project I am going to:

Create a dynamic application that works in all modern browsers.
Use data binding to wire up your data model to your views.
Create and run unit tests, with Karma.
Create and run end to end tests, with Protractor.
Move application logic out of the template and into Controllers.
Get data from a server using Angular services.
Apply animations to your application, using ngAnimate.
